title: About the Loper House
---

The Loper House was built in 1915, according to the [National Historic Register](http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/colleton/S10817715007/pages/WHD33.htm).  It was built earlier (mid-1900s) according to family lore.  [Lula Loper Glover and Edmund Carrol Glover](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/155539110/lula-glover) received building materials from an old structure as a wedding present.  Lula purchased purchased the deed as a married woman, which was unusual for the late 1800s.  Edmund was a small businessman, who ran a small bakery in Walterboro. Lula's possession of the home's deed protected it from seizure, if Edmund's business became bankrupt.
